# Mesa

Simple message web application to demonstrate:
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
* [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org)
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

## Running Locally

You can run this demo locally inside of a virtual machine. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) on your system. Then download this repository to your system, change into that directory, and run

    vagrant up

This will set up an [Ubuntu 14.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/) virtual machine and install all of this project's required software inside of that machine. Once Vagrant has finished building the machine, open http://192.168.33.10/ in a web browser to visit and use the web application.
